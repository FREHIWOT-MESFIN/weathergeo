# She-Codes-Africa Project Challenge: Build a Weather Forecast App with Geolocation and Data Caching

## Project Overview
The Weather Forecast App is an interactive web application designed to provide users with real-time weather information and forecasts based on their location or a searched city. Utilizing the Geolocation API, the app retrieves the user's current position, while also allowing searches for any city. It presents essential weather-related data in a user-friendly layout, complete with charts and dynamic visuals. The app features caching to enhance performance and minimize unnecessary API calls, ensuring an optimal user experience.

## Features
+ Geolocation Integration: Automatically fetches and displays the current weather based on the user's geographical location.
+ Search Functionality: Allows users to search for weather data in any city.
Current Weather and 7-Day Forecast: Displays comprehensive weather details, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecasts.
+ Data Caching: Caches weather data using localStorage, reducing redundant API calls and enhancing performance by limiting requests to once per day.
+ Dark Mode: Offers a visually appealing dark mode option for user preference.
+ Error Handling: Implements graceful error handling during API calls to ensure a smooth user experience.
## Challenges Faced
While developing the Weather Forecast App, I encountered several challenges that enhanced my learning experience:

+ Geolocation API Usage: Integrating the Geolocation API required a deeper understanding of how to handle user permissions and ensure privacy, which was a valuable learning curve.

+ Data Caching Logic: Implementing effective caching logic using localStorage to manage data expiration and retrieval required careful consideration and testing.

## Lessons Learned
Throughout this project, I gained several key insights:

+ Advanced API Integration: I improved my ability to work with external APIs, including managing authentication and error responses effectively.

+ React Hooks Proficiency: My understanding of React Hooks, particularly useState and useEffect, deepened as I navigated side effects and state management throughout the app.

+ Performance Optimization Techniques: Learning about memoization with useMemo() and useCallback() helped me prevent excessive re-renders, ultimately enhancing the app's performance.


This project not only strengthened my technical skills but also ignited my passion for building engaging web applications. I am excited to present this Weather Forecast App and showcase my development journey!
